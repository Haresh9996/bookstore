                Founded in 2024 by Jane Doe, Book Haven has come a long way from its beginnings in a home office. When Jane first started out, her passion for "books that touch your soul" drove her to do intense research, quit her day job, and gave her the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into a booming online store. We now serve customers all over the world and are thrilled to be a part of the quirky, eco-friendly, fair trade wing of the book industry.
